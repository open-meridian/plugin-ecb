# meridian-ecb

The European Central Bank's euro foreign exchange reference rates as an Open
Meridian data plugin, in Python on the open-meridian SDK (0.31.0, contract
v26). It runs beside a sidecar in a Meridian deployment and puts each TARGET
business day's reference rates into the deployment's lake, each rate the
price of the euro's cash instrument in the other currency, as the ECB quotes
it. What it may publish and subscribe to comes from its one role, `data`,
declared in `pyproject.toml`, once a deployment admin approves it. It is
stage 0 of the ECB's data plugin: meridian-design's
`spec/a-public-rates-and-filings-data-plugin.md` (rulings 343 to 349 made it
one plugin per publisher's feed).

## What it is

- `src/ecb/portal.py` asks the ECB's Data Portal one kind of request, every
  currency's daily reference rate against the euro over a range of days as
  SDMX-CSV, with the standard library, one at a time, at most one every two
  seconds, `If-Modified-Since` on the hourly check; `SyntheticPortal`
  answers from the real answer committed under `src/ecb/responses/`.
- `src/ecb/rates.py` reads the SDMX-CSV: each currency's code, day and
  rate as written, per euro, in units; a value that is not a number kept as
  not read.
- `src/ecb/convert.py` makes each rate a `Price`: a close for its business
  date in Frankfurt's day, the price of the euro's cash instrument in the
  other currency, never inverted.
- `src/ecb/feed.py` resolves the euro and every currency by `iso4217`
  (W3.1) and reports what does not resolve (W3.2), records in batches of at
  most 500 (W10.4) and answers the lake's wants or declines them per
  subject (W10.7), through the SDK's `meridian.roles.data.Wants`.
- `src/ecb/target.py` reads the dataset's calendar, TARGET's closing days
  (`ReadCalendar`), for the next rates expected and the days asked that the
  ECB publishes nothing on.
- `src/ecb/raw.py` keeps every answer as received in the storage the
  deployment grants, notes the answer each rate was first read from, and
  moves months past their window as the SDK's settings say.
- `src/ecb/page.py`, `records.py` and `templates/` are the data role's two
  pages under Manage (spec/plugin-pages-follow-their-role), Connection and
  Datasets, each a read tool (`read_connection`, `read_datasets`) on the
  deployment's MCP answering the role's common fields,
  `meridian.roles.data`'s records extended with the ECB's (Sources; Lag and
  Records). The templates extend the role's and add the ECB's nuance at its
  blocks alone (`vendor_notices`, `vendor_rows`, `vendor_columns`,
  `vendor_sections`): never rename, reorder or drop a common section, row,
  column or label.

## The rules it keeps

- **A data plugin shows no price.** Its pages show its connection, its datasets and
  how its subjects resolve; a rate is the reading roles' to show. A test
  holds every page to it.
- **Exact decimals.** A rate is made a `Decimal` from the text the portal
  wrote, never a `float`; `1.1225` stays `1.1225`.
- **Nothing inverted, nothing guessed.** Every rate is per euro, as the
  portal's `CURRENCY_DENOM` says; an answer that is not is refused. A day
  with no rate is no rate, never a zero.
- **Every subject resolved first,** by its ISO 4217 code, as of now, said,
  and every miss reported with its reason; never a currency defined here:
  core answers with the platform master's, pulled; a currency that does not
  resolve is left out until it does, and no rate goes while the euro does
  not.
- **Every row names its raw record,** kept before anything is read from it,
  and the same rate always names the answer it was first read from.
- **A published time only where known:** the portal's Last-Modified, for a
  rate first read on its own day; none otherwise.
- **Stateless.** The process holds nothing it cannot lose: a restart reads
  the portal again and the lake answers what it recorded before unchanged.
- **Real answers are committed** because the ECB allows reuse with the ECB
  cited; record a new one with `curl` from the portal, gzip it into
  `src/ecb/responses/`, and describe it in its `index.json` with its Date
  and Last-Modified headers.
- **The suite.** `tests/test_suite.py` runs `meridian.suites.run("data", ...)`
  on the plugin's own conversion, and passes: a case about a kind of data
  the ECB never states (a bar, a crypto asset, a venue, a security another
  source named, trades, quotes, settlement dates, outcomes) is named in
  `not_presented` with why. Never write a producer that invents what the ECB
  does not state.
- **Stage 0 only.** €STR and the other rates come with the lake's rates
  kinds; nothing here records a rate as a price.

## Checking it locally

    make ci-local                     # lint, tests, plugin check, image, e2e: the pre-push gate
    make preview SHOTS=/tmp/shots     # each page in a browser with the kit, at 375, 582 and 1280 px

`make e2e` runs the plugin on core's plugin harness beside a reading plugin
(`e2e/reader.py`), the ECB's portal unreachable (`e2e/hosts`) until
synthetic mode is on, and compares the lake with `e2e/expected.lake`. Every
gate runs in a container: the host needs only Docker and Python 3 for the
e2e's runner.

This file is for any coding agent working on the plugin, and is committed with
it for whoever works on it next. It is the canonical one: `CLAUDE.md` and the
`develop-live` skill lead Claude Code here rather than repeating it.
`.dockerignore` keeps all of them out of the image and the live instance.

## Checking it: `meridian plugin check`

Whatever in this file can be decided from the text is checked, not only
said: `meridian plugin check` holds the plugin to the rules every Meridian
plugin is built to (the template's
shape, `[tool.meridian]`, the kit linked and no raw colour, nothing from
another origin, settings declared rather than read from the environment, no
secret logged or put in a page, the deployment reached only through the SDK,
and tests). It needs no deployment and no session, and changes nothing. It
came in `meridian` 0.1.15; with an older one, the person runs
`meridian upgrade`.

- **Run `meridian plugin check` after each change.** Exit 0: every rule
  holds. Exit 1: at least one does not. Each failure names the rule, the file
  and line, and what to write instead: fix each one as it says, then run it
  again, until it exits 0. Never work around a rule; if one seems wrong for
  this plugin, tell the person.
- **`meridian plugin check --run-tests`** also runs the tests under `tests/`
  with pytest, in the plugin's `.venv` if it has one, otherwise with the
  `python3` on the PATH, which needs the plugin and pytest installed
  (`pip install -e . pytest`). `tests/test_page.py` asks the pages under
  Manage, Open and View with `meridian.testing.PageClient`, and the operation
  they send against a stand-in for the sidecar; replace its tests as you
  replace the pages, and add one for each page and each operation.
- The plugin's CI (`.github/workflows/check.yaml`) runs the same
  `meridian plugin check --run-tests` on every push.

What the check cannot decide stays advice, below: which component fits, the
page's layout, custom properties the kit does not define, figures as strings,
and names.

## Building its pages: the kit

Build every page with Open Meridian's plugin UI kit, and nothing else for its
look. Then it looks like the rest of the platform, follows each person's
colour scheme, light or dark, and their market-direction convention, and
needs no design work. The kit is plain CSS and web components: it works from
plain HTML, as the templates write it, and from React, Vue or Svelte alike.

**It is linked for you.** Each page's template, under `templates/`, is a
Jinja2 template that extends the SDK's base template,
`{% extends "meridian/base.html" %}`, which links the kit from the path the
dashboard serves it at on this plugin's own host and draws the page's heading
and tab row (the kit drops both when the dashboard frames the page and draws
its own). A template fills three blocks: `content`, the page itself;
`head_actions`, buttons marked `data-om-action="<id>"`, which the dashboard
draws in its header; and `status`, an `<om-status data-om-header>` it draws
beside the plugin's name. `pages.render("x.html", ...)` renders it, every
value escaped, with `caller` and `level` (admin, write or read) in it; a
template adapts by `{% if level == "write" %}`, and `{% include %}` and
macros share pieces between pages. A form that posts puts `{{ csrf_input }}`
inside it (a script sends `request.csrf_token` as `X-CSRF-Token`): every
request but GET and HEAD without this plugin's token is refused before the
view runs, so another site's page cannot act here as the person. A GET
changes nothing.

Never copy the kit into the plugin, and never load it, or anything else for
the page, from another origin or a CDN.

**Which component for what:**

| For | Use |
|---|---|
| A table of records | `<om-grid row-key="…">`: set `columns`, then `setRows(rows)`; `upsert(rows)` replaces rows by key in place; figures sort exactly |
| A stream: thousands of rows, many changes a second | `<om-grid high-rate>`: only the rows in view are drawn, only changed cells are touched, and they flash up or down; `freeze-sort` stops rows jumping while streaming |
| Live data from the plugin's server | `<om-live src="events" snapshot="snapshot.json" for="grid-id">`: follows server-sent events in sequence, and reads the snapshot again after a gap or a reconnect, so nothing is missed |
| The date the figures are as of | `<om-asof>` |
| Choosing an instrument | `<om-instrument-picker src="…" asof="…">`, searching through the plugin's own server |
| A time series | `<om-chart type="line">` (or `bar`), `series` set in script |
| Several views on one page, resizable and rearrangeable | `<om-panels layout-id="…">`, a `data-panel` child per view; each person's arrangement is remembered |
| Everything else | The kit's classes: `.page`, `.page-head`, `.panel` and `.panel-body`, `.tiles`, `.tabs`, `.field`, `.filters`, `.notice`, `.badge`, `button.primary` and `.danger`, `table` and `.num`, `.empty-state` |

Give a component its data as JSON inside it, `<script
type="application/json">{{ grid | tojson }}</script>`, which needs no script of the
page's; or set it (`columns`, `rows`, `series`) as properties, in a
`customElements.whenDefined(...)` callback. The kit's README
(open-meridian/meridian-ui) documents every component, attribute and event.

**Colour.** Only the kit's custom properties, never a hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()` or
a colour's name: not in a stylesheet, an inline style, an SVG or a script. A
person chooses their scheme and their deployment's administrator may add
schemes; a raw colour is one no scheme can change and no contrast check has
seen. Prefer a class to a property, and a property to anything else:

- surfaces `--page`, `--card`, `--hover`; text `--ink`, `--ink-soft`,
  `--ink-faint`; edges `--line`, `--line-soft`, `--line-strong`
- `--accent` and `--accent-wash`; `--primary` and `--primary-ink`
- status, which never changes meaning: `--good`, `--danger`, `--warn-ink`,
  `--violet`, each with its `-wash`
- **market direction:** `--buy` for a buy, a rise or a gain, and `--sell` for a
  sell, a fall or a loss, with `--buy-wash` and `--sell-wash`. Never green and
  red, and never `--good` and `--danger`, for a price move: where a person
  reads red as up (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) the kit swaps buy and sell for
  them. In markup, `.buy-ink` and `.sell-ink`, `.badge.buy` and `.badge.sell`;
  in a grid, a column's `tone: "sign"`.

Spacing, radii, shadows and type are the kit's too: `var(--space-1)` to
`var(--space-10)`, `var(--radius)`, `var(--shadow)`, `var(--sans)`,
`var(--mono)`.

**No chrome, no theme code.** The dashboard frames the page and draws the
plugin's name, its tab row, the way back to the dashboard and the person. The
page draws only its content, which the base template puts inside `<main
class="page">`: no header bar, navigation, logo, sign-in or sign-out, and no
light and dark switch. The kit applies the
person's theme, which the frame hands it, with no code of the page's.

**Money is exact.** Send prices and quantities to the page as decimal strings
and show them as sent; never `parseFloat` one. The grid sorts them exactly.

**The kit's rules, which a page keeps too:** no raw colour; no custom
property the kit does not define, other than the page's own layout ones; the
page reaches only its own origin, the plugin's server, which proxies anything
further; figures are strings, never floats.

**Where the kit is not served.** Until every dashboard serves `/.meridian/ui/`,
build pages that work without it, as the templates do: put a plain `<table>`
inside `<om-grid>` (a browser shows it as it is, and the kit's grid replaces
it), give components their data as JSON inside them, and make actions plain
forms. Without the kit the page is unstyled, but everything on it works.

A short page, whole: the view, in `page.py`,

```python
COLUMNS = [
    {"key": "symbol", "label": "Instrument"},
    {"key": "quantity", "label": "Quantity", "type": "decimal", "group": True},
    {"key": "market_value", "label": "Market value", "type": "decimal", "group": True},
    {"key": "day_pnl", "label": "Day P&L", "type": "decimal", "group": True, "tone": "sign"},
]


@pages.page("/positions", "Positions", levels=["write", "read"])
def positions(request: meridian.Request) -> str:
    return pages.render("positions.html", grid={"columns": COLUMNS, "rows": []})
```

and its template, `templates/positions.html`:

```html+jinja
{% extends "meridian/base.html" %}
{% block head_actions %}
<om-live src="events" snapshot="positions.json" for="positions"></om-live>
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<p class="muted">Every account you may read here.</p>
<section class="panel">
  <om-grid id="positions" row-key="position_id" high-rate sort="market_value:desc" caption="Positions">
    <script type="application/json">{{ grid | tojson }}</script>
    <table><tr><th>Instrument</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Market value</th></tr></table>
  </om-grid>
</section>
{% endblock %}
```

The plugin's server answers `positions.json` with `{ "sequence": "41", "rows":
[…] }` and `events` as server-sent events, each `id: <sequence>` and `data:
{ "rows": […] }` carrying whole records; `om-live` feeds them to the grid.

## Developing it live

On a Meridian deployment installed for development, `meridian plugin dev`
runs this plugin as you write it: each saved file is sent, the plugin's process
restarts on it in the same pod, and it is running again in about a second. The
pod, its sidecar and what it is allowed to do stay as they were.

Everything here runs on the person's own session with the deployment, and is
theirs.

### Before starting

- `meridian --version` is 0.1.21 or later. Older ones have no `--level` on
  `plugin open`, before 0.1.15 no `plugin check`, and before 0.1.3 no
  `plugin dev`: the person runs `meridian upgrade`.
- The person has run `meridian connect` (with the address, for a deployment
  not on this machine). You cannot do it for them: it signs in through their
  browser. `meridian plugin list` says whether the
  session is there: it lists the catalogue, or exits **3**. Whenever any
  command exits 3, the session is missing or has lapsed. Stop, tell the person
  to run the `meridian connect` the command printed, and carry on once they
  have. There is no `meridian status`.
- The deployment was installed for development (`meridian up --development`).
  Elsewhere `plugin dev` is refused, and nothing is wrong with the plugin.

### Start the loop

The instance is called `ecb` below. Use whatever the person
wants it called, and the same name in every command.

**The first time an instance is launched, the person approves what it asks
for.** Show them the `roles` in `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.meridian]`
and ask. Only once they say yes, pass `--yes`; never pass it to get past a
question they have not answered. An instance that is live already asks
nothing.

Run it in the background, and keep it running for the whole session:

```sh
mkdir -p .meridian
meridian plugin dev --instance ecb --yes --json > .meridian/dev.jsonl 2> .meridian/dev.err
```

Its output goes under `.meridian/` on purpose. `plugin dev` sends every file
in this directory that changes, except `.meridian/` and what `.dockerignore`
names. Anywhere else in this directory, its own output would be sent to the
plugin as a change, again and again. Not under your own agent's directory
(`.claude/`, `.cursor/` and the like) either: some agents guard theirs, and
writing there needs a permission a session may not have. `.meridian/` is
git-ignored, since it is this session's, not the plugin's.

`.meridian/dev.jsonl` gets one JSON object a line:

| `event` | Means |
|---|---|
| `seeded` | The live folder was filled from the plugin's image, the first time it runs live |
| `sent` | This process sent a change; `revision` is the number it was given |
| `synced` | The sidecar wrote it |
| `restarted` | The plugin's process started on that revision |
| `ready` | It connected to its sidecar again: that revision is running |
| `crashed` | It stopped with an error. `traceback` has the last of what it printed |
| `exited` | It stopped by itself, without an error |
| `refused` | The sidecar refused it something; `reason` says what |

Wait for the first `ready` before changing anything. `.meridian/dev.err` says
what it is doing, and why it stopped if it did. The first run builds and
uploads the plugin's image, which takes a minute or two.

### Change something

1. Edit and save. There is nothing to run: the save is the deploy.
2. Find the `sent` line after your save, and its `revision`, R.
3. Wait for `ready` or `crashed` at R. Nothing about R is known before then.
4. On `crashed`, read its `traceback`, fix the cause, and save again: the next
   revision replaces it. Nothing needs restarting.

Several saves close together can land as one revision. Read the newest `sent`.

### Check it

Ask the question that answers what you changed:

| To know | Run |
|---|---|
| What a page shows, as the person is served it | `meridian plugin open --instance ecb --level open --print /` for Accounts under Open (`--level view` under View), and `--level manage --print /setup` for Setup under Manage: any path on the plugin, at a level it is declared with |
| What the plugin printed or logged since your change | `meridian plugin logs --instance ecb --since <R-1>` |
| What the sidecar refused it, or what else happened | `meridian plugin events --instance ecb --since <R-1> --json` |
| What the person sees in a browser | `meridian plugin open --instance ecb --level open`: a link one browser opens once, at that level. Give it to the person, or open it in your browser pane |

`--level` is the home's button the session is opened by: `manage`, `open` or
`view`. Name it every time. A page answers 403 at a level it is not declared
with, and without `--level` the dashboard opens at the first level the person
holds, Manage before Open before View, so on a development deployment, where
they hold `admin`, `/` would be asked under Manage and refused.

`--print` exits non-zero when the plugin answers with an error, and prints what
it answered. Prefer it to a browser for checking your own work: it needs no
browser and gives the same page every time.

### What a save cannot change

- **What it is allowed to do.** A `refused` event is its grants working, not a
  bug to code around. Adding a role to `pyproject.toml` changes nothing
  live: it takes a new version, and a person approves it.
- **Its dependencies.** The live code runs on the image the instance was
  launched from. A new package in `pyproject.toml` needs a new version.

Tell the person when a change needs either, rather than looking for a way
round it.

### Release it

When the person is satisfied:

1. Run `meridian plugin check --run-tests`, and fix what fails until it
   exits 0.
2. Raise `version` in `pyproject.toml`. A version is never replaced.
3. Show the person the roles again, and get their yes.
4. Run `meridian plugin dev --release --instance ecb --yes`.

That uploads this directory as that version and runs it in place of the live
instance. It is then an ordinary version in the deployment's catalogue.

### Stop

Stop the background `plugin dev`. The instance keeps running, live, as it was.
`meridian plugin stop ecb` ends it, which is the person's call.
